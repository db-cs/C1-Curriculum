## What will I learn in this unit?

The goal of this unit is to learn about Frontend Development on the web. We will be utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS to build a simple app to start. Then you will use this model app to design, develop, and deploy a project of your own design.

## What will I make in this unit?

At the end of the unit, you will have build a frontend web project that solves a person or societal issue. You will also have build a couple of model apps along the way.

## Standards Assessed in This Unit

- **CRD1** - For practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue, developers design and iteratively develop computational artifacts.
- **CRD2** - Incorporating feedback from users, developers systematically design and develop programs for broad audiences.
- **AAP1** - To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, developers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP3** - Developers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, developers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow developers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

## Essential Questions

- What is frontend development?
- How do developers utilize HTML, CSS, and JS to build web applicaitons?
