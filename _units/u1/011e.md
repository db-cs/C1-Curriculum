It's time to update your Dev Blog with a new post. Remember your blog is there for you to reflect and document your learning. Everyone is in different places, so each blog will be different.

We're going to follow an "Expanded Definition" format, and our topic will be "What is Frontend Development".

## Structuring Your Post

**Title:** What is Frontend Development?

### Intro

Start by defining Frontend Development in your own words. Anyone can Google it themselves. Provide your own insights. What technologies are commonly used? Why is it called Frontend?

### Reflection on Learning

Here's where we'll depart from the Expanded Definition a bit. Instead of additional questions. You're going to refer to the Pinboard project you have built over the last few weeks, and use it as an example of what Frontend development is all about. Throughout the examples talk about what you have learned. This is the most important part. If you don't explain what you learned, you have missed the boat.

Use screenshots and code snippets to enhance your post. Images can be added to the assets folder. Then you can use `{{site.url}}/assets/image-title.jpg` when you add your image source. For example:

{% highlight markdown %}
![Image Description]({{site.url}}/assets/image-title.jpg)
{% endhighlight %}

Code snippets can be added with triple back ticks. For example:

{% highlight markdown %}
```javascript
  // Add your code here...
```
{% endhighlight %}

### Conclusion

Summarize what you have learned about Frontend Development, and explain what you will try to learn next.
