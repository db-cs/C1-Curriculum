We will be completing some JavaScript Exercises together in class. You'll need to open the project below in Repl.it, and follow along. Recordings of the exercises will be recorded and posted below for review.

## W3 Schools

Using documentation as you develop is a key skill that you will need to master. W3 schools is one of many documentation websites out there, and it follows the normal format you'll find used in documentation sites (definitions and examples).

## Hello, World!

We'll start out with a traditional Hello World. Here's the code to add to your `index.html`.

```html
<h1 id="hello" onClick="change()">Hello, World!</h1>
```

```javascript
// Hello world
console.log("Hello, world!");

var hello = document.getElementById("hello");
console.log(hello);

function change() {
  hello.innerHTML = "Hello, earth!";
}
// change()
```

Note that `//` indicates a comment that the computer will ignore.

The `.` is referred to as the dot operator. Each of the elements are objects, which means they have properties (values of HTML Elements that you can set or change) and methods (actions you can perform on HTML Elements). The dot operator allows us to access properties and methods on the object.

A function is a pre-defined set of steps that has a name. We use the `function` keyword to define our function. The `()` are required and we'll learn more about those later. Like a method a function performs actions and usualy starts with a verb. Functions will not run unless you call them by name.

## DOM Exercise 1

We're going to be parsing through text elements in the DOM today and learning how to alter parts of them. Additionally we will be learning how to create elements using Javascript.

Add the following to your `index.html` (it's okay to copy and paste his one ðŸ˜œ):

```html
<h1>Long Words</h1>
<p>
  It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
  breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker
  Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured
  houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs
  through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the
  white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not
  been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning,
  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession
  of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he
  had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary
  shortcomings.

```
