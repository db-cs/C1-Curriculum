## What will I learn in this unit?

We are going to apply some of the skills we have learned about building backends to create a competitive battlesnake. Battlesnake is an autonomous programmming competition that pits your snake against others in a game of survival. We'll start with some solo challenges, and work our way into a whole class bracket.

## What will I make in this unit?

You'll be developing a server that controls your Battlesnake through HTTP API requests/responses. This is how the web works, so this is a great transition as we start moving towards frontend user interfaces. Your snake will complete a series of challenges and finally be pitted against others in a double-elimination tournament.

## Essential Questions

- What is an algorithm?

## Standards Assessed in This Unit

- **CRD1** - For practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue, developers design and iteratively develop computational artifacts.
- **CRD2** - Incorporating feedback from users, developers systematically design and develop programs for broad audiences.
- **CRD4** - Working in team roles using collaborative tools, developers design and develop computational artifacts.
- **AAP1** - To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, developers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP2** - The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Developers incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP3** - Developers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, developers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow developers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.
