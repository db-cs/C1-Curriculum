## Overview

Start by looking back over your development journal. How did your understanding of the problem evolve over the two weeks? What did you learn about problem solving? What does it mean to think algorithmically?

- **Problem** - What were you trying to solve?
- **Process (Pains and Gains)** - What did you do? The good, the bad, and the ugly.
- **Key Takaways** - What did you learn from the build?
- **What's Next** - What steps will you take next?

## Game Gifs

Since you will have completed multiple games and several challenges, it would be good to include the gifs of the game so that your readers can visualize what you have created. Include at least one gif from a challenge or a match.

To add a gif to your markdown:

```markdown
![Alternate title for the image](link_to_the_gif.gif)
```

Here's an example:

## Code Snippets

In addition to showing the results of the game, you should also include code snippets as you explain what you developed. Pick out parts that show a particular struggle or triumph. You should include at least one snippet from your code.

To use code in your blog post with syntax highlighting:

`````markdown
````javascript
// You can add code and it will be syntax highlighted
console.log("This will be syntax highlighted");
// ``` Don't forget backticks to close the code block
````
`````
