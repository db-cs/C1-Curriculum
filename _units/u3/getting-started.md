## Starter Project

Each team will get a starter snake on Repl.it that includes some basic boilerplate to get you started. You will need to significantly improve the code in order to be competitive. We will work in class to discuss strategies and potential solutions.

You may want to create multiple snakes to test and experiment. Feel free to fork the project, but your tournament snake needs to be on the Team Repl.it.

Additionally, you should check your code in to GitHub. It's okay to create a private repository, so no one can see your code. I leave that up to you. I do what you to add me as a collaborator, so I can monitor your programming practices.

## Documentation

Battlesnake provides extensive documentation on their website that will be essential in your understanding of the competition. Start by reading through the docs. Then explore other resources out there that may be helpful to your team.

## Battlesnake Account

You'll need to setup an account for Battlesnake, so you can register your snake and test. **Use GitHub to sign up.**

[Sign Up for Battlesnake](https://battlesnake.com/login){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

Once you are logged in create a new team and add your teammate as a member. Then you can register your Battlesnake with your team.

## Dev Journal

As you develop your snake, you will record your progress each day on Canvas in a Developer Journal. This is a little different than our blog as it will be private between us. Here are the expectations for each day's entry:

- Minimum 100-200 words
- Summary of progress and activities completed (what did you do?)
- Biggest takeaways from the day (what did you learn?)
- Struggles from the day (what's holding you back?)
