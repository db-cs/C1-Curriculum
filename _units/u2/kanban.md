## What is Kanban?

Kanban was developed by the automotive industry. The goal was to efficiently break a problem down into smaller tasks and then organize the order they need to be completed.

We'll be using smaller boards to keep track of our projects. While many teams use digital versions of kanban boards, the best way to learn the process is to use a physical board. These boards will serve as a project management resource.

### Agile

Kanban boards are common tools within agile project management. There are two major classifications of project management in software development: waterfall and agile. Most companies use a variation of agile project management, so we will adopt some of these practices with our team.

As you can see, agile project management is all about deploying early and often. This requires breaking things down into smaller features than can be lauched and tested. Typically you will hear these short development cycles referred to as **sprints**. We'll work in one week sprints for now and the goal will be to deploy our current set of features by the end fo the week. Rather than working on many different features all at once, this keeps the focus on what will help move closer to finishing the sprint.

### Stand-Up Meeting

Another commom practice is what is called a daily stand-up. Productivity is often hampered by long meetings. In order to combat this, stand-ups are used to keep meetings short and focused. The meeting is done at your kanban board. You should stand during the meeting. No one is comfortable which ensures the meeting will be short.

The meeting revolves around the three questions below. The kanban board should facilitate this converstation. The primary goal is to ensure the whole team knows what tasks have been completed and what tasks need immediate attention.

This week you will practice stand-up meetings with your team. Yes you need to stand-up, and yes it does require you to talk. A larger part of software development is communication and collaboration. If you want undertand what it's like to work in this industry you need to experience industry standard practices. Take this part serious, because writing code is only a small part of what you are tasked with as a developer.

## Let's Setup Your Board

You will work with your team to setup your board. You will not identify all the tasks all at once, and your backlog will grow as you develop your software. Your team will need a good list of tasks to start with. The following steps should help guide your team as they setup the baord.

1. Decide on a single feature you want to finish by the end of the week (1 sprint).
   - The feature should be focused but also big enough to make progress on the larger app
   - It's better to keep the scope narrow. You can always start a new feature if you finish early.
1. Break that feature down into smaller components (tasks).
   - Development
   - Testing
   - Documentation
1. Place all the tasks into the backlog.
1. Discuss what tasks need to be completed first and place them in the Do section of your board.
