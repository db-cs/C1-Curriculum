## What will I learn in this unit?

We are going to be learning how to create a backend that will send commands to the drone. The backend will have a simple Application Programming Interface (API) which we will later use to drive the drone.

## What will I make in this unit?

You'll be developing a backend that will send commands to the drone to fly a simple mission. The mission will be a timed trial race where you must navigate a course using the Backend API developed by your team. This will be the first time we are working on something as a team, so we will also learn more about collaboration using tools and techniques.

## Standards Assessed in This Unit

- **CRD1** - For practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue, developers design and iteratively develop computational artifacts.
- **CRD2** - Incorporating feedback from users, developers systematically design and develop programs for broad audiences.
- **CRD4** - Working in team roles using collaborative tools, developers design and develop computational artifacts.
- **AAP1** - To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, developers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP3** - Developers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, developers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow developers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

## Essential Questions

- How are messages sent on the internet?
- How do developers collaborate on a software project?
- What is backend development?
