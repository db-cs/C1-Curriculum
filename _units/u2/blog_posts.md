## Getting Started

Blogging as a developer is an important activity that allows you to record your growth as a developer and share what you have learned with others. The development community is built around sharing. Learning how to code and build things with technology involves risktaking and lots of exploration. It is very helpful to read about someone elses journey, and it is equally important to share your own.

## Two Structures

There are two basic structures you can follow for your blog posts.

### Build Log

The build log is a record of a project or part of a project that you have built. The goal is a to share the problem you were seeking to solve and how it went. The key here is to share what you learned during the process.

- **Problem** - What were you trying to solve?
- **Process (Pains and Gains)** - What did you do? The good, the bad, and the ugly.
- **Key Takaways** - What did you learn from the build?
- **What's Next** - What steps will you take next?

### Tutorial

The tutorial structure is all about teaching someone how to build something. The goal is to share what you have learned in a way that someone else can recreate it. The key here is to break it down step by step.

- **Final Product** - What will it look like when finished?
- **Step-by-Step Guide** - What are the steps to build it?
- **What's Next** - How can you improve/extend on the tutorial?

## Use Images to Tell the Story

Image are key to a good post. Start by putting in some headings to create an outline of what you will write. Then start adding images and code segments. Most readers will skim your post, but they'll spend quite a bit of time looking at images. Use screenshots and photographs to visually tell your story. Usually you can add a sentence or two to add some content and your blog is basically done. 

## Markdown Tricks

Use headings to organize and break your post up into smaller chunks.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

Link to important documents or your GitHub repo. Don't forget the `http://` or `https://`.

```markdown
[What the Reader Sees](https://linktodocument.com)
```

Use code in your blog post with syntax highlighting.

```markdown
```javascript
  // You can add code and it will be syntax highlighted
  console.log("This will be syntax highlighted");
```// Don't forget backticks to close the code block 
```
