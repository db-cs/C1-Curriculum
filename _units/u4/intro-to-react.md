title: Introduction to React
unit: Front-End with React
order: 1
objectives:
  - Understand that React is an abstraction of what can already do with JavaScript.
  - Understand that React uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) to render elements.
  - Understand that JSX is an easier syntax to write and read, but requires transpiling with Babel.

## Overview of the Task

1. Watch the video above.
1. Open the [Introduction to React on Repl.it](https://replit.com/team/dbcs/013-ReactIntro-To-React).
1. Follow along to experiment with React.

Finish the tutorial already? Try to implement one of the following:

- Create nested elements.
- Extract information into variables and pass it into a React element.

### Unpkg Links

In order to follow along, you'll need the following packages. Unlike previously when we installed using NPM, you are just going to be adding them manually to the HTML file. While this is a different method, the effect is the same.

**Notes:** In the video the versions are slightly older. The following are the latest versions of React, React DOM, and Babel.

```
https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/react.development.js
https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.development.js
https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.js
```

### Experimenting with Babel

The role Babel plays in the tool chain and what Babel is transpiling is important to understand.

1. Open the [Babel Repl](https://babeljs.io/repl).
1. Experiment with creating JSX.
1. Examine the resulting React.createElement.

**Takeaway:** Underneath JSX and React is purely JavaScript.
