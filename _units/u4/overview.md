unit: Front-End with React

## What will I learn in this unit?

- How to create a front-end application using React.js.
- How to apply the concept of state to your application.
- How to connect to a public REST API and consume data for a Front-End UI.
- How to infer and draw conclusions from software documentation that will help you build your application.

## What will I make in this unit?

You'll be building a front-end user interface for a REST API. The REST API is a publicly accesible backend that will provide data in JSON format.

### REST API Choices

- [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev/)
- [math.tools/api/numbers](https://math.tools/api/numbers/)
- [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/)

You may choose another option if you'd like, but I need to approve it before you begin working.

### Project Guidelines

- Your app should have at least two pages.
- Your app must consume data from at least two different API endpoints.
- Your app must use a form element as input to fetch data.
- Your app must contain at least two custom components.
- Your app must be free of bugs and have proper commenting.

## Demo Project

In order to demonstrate some of the techniques you'll need to complete this assignment, I'll be using a Jeopardy REST API to create a triva game.

## Standards Assessed in This Unit

- **CRD1** - For practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue, developers design and iteratively develop computational artifacts.
- **CRD2** - Incorporating feedback from users, developers systematically design and develop programs for broad audiences.
- **AAP1** - To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, developers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP2** - The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Developers incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP3** - Developers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, developers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow developers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.
