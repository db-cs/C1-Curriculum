# ðŸ’» Welcome to C1

## What will I learn in this unit?

We're just getting started. The goal of this unit is to get you comfortable with Canvas and to introduce the ways you'll be graded on the assignments we complete in class. Additionally, we will have a chance to explore some careers in Computer Science (CS).

## What will I make in this unit?

At the end of the unit, you will make a brief presentation on a CS career that interests you.

## Objectives

- Understand and demonstrate the use of Canvas to submit assignments and complete activities.
- Understand the course standards and how assignments are graded.
- Create a presentation that explores and evaluates a CS career that interests you.

## Essential Questions

- What careers are related to Computer Science?
- What kinds of skills, knowledge, and credentials are necessary to be successful in a Computer Science career?

<!-- ## What Is This Course?

C1 is the second course in the Coding program of study. In this course, we will dive deeply into programming constructs and professional practices.

## Who Is This Course For?

C1 is the second course in the Coding program of study. It is designed for students that are curious about software development and want to go deeper into how to write programs. You should feel comfortable with Algebra concepts.

## What Will I Learn?

During the course you'll learn to:

- deconstruct real-world problems
- collaborate with others to create solutions
- write algortihms that describe solutions to the computer

## How Do I Succeed In This Course?

To be successful in this course, you need to be curious about how programming works. Ask questions and think deeply. You must move beyond just writing the correct code, and start using computational and algorithmic thinking.

You will need to read carefully and think deeply. You must be willing work with others and listen to their ideas.

**ðŸ‘‰ The number one way to succeed in this class is to be engaged. Soak up everything you can from every assignment and experience.**

## What Are The Expectations?

- We deliver our best work, not just our first work.
- We give grace to others and ourselves.
- We consider the impacts of our decisions and deal with the consequences of our actions.
- We value the contributions of our team and celebrate our successes.

## What If I Need Accomodations?

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. -->
