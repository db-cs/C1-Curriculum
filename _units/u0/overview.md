## What will I learn in this unit?

We're just getting started. The goal of this unit is to get you comfortable with Canvas and to introduce the ways you'll be graded on the assignments we complete in class. Additionally, we will have a chance to explore GitHub and some of the features we will use throughout the semester.

## What will I make in this unit?

At the end of the unit, you have built a developer blog that we will use this semester to reflect and publish your progress. Blogging is a typical developer activity that allows you to reflect on your work, publish your progress, and get noticed by potential employers.
