## I'm a nerd

I'm a nerd. No really... According to the dictionary, I fit the definition.

> "A nerd engages in or discusses a technical field obsessively or with great attention to detail."

Unfortunately, I'm interested in EVERYTHING. From backpacking in the mountains to hand wiring mechanical keyboards, I'm obsessed with learning and knowing everything about how something works. Luckily I have an awesome wife that puts up with all my "hobbies".

I like to game. I currently am playing Destiny 2 on my custom built PC or playing Super Mario Bros 3 on my Switch. I also like to hike and spend time outdoors. Being out in nature refuels my spirit. I've hiked the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Badlands, and many more. I'm also an avid reader, and I love some good science fiction or fantasy.

I love my pets. We have 2 dogs and a cat, and they rule my life. I wouldn't trade them for the world though. I'm also artistic. My bachelor's degree is in Painting and Drawing. I have done solo shows with my paintings, and I still make [artwork with my camera](https://dnbailey.org){:target="\_blank"}.

The most important thing you should know about me is that I care. **You are the reason I walk through the doors of the school each morning.** I want to get to know your passions and interests. I also want you to succeed in my class and in life. I'm here for you.

## The World Always Changes

My personal motto is `Never Stop Learning`. The world never stands still, and there is always something new to learn and explore. This is what drives me, and I hope to share with you some of the things that I have learned. One of the most important lessons in Tech is that everything changes. Really the only thing that is constant is that nothing is constant. What is relevant today will be laughable in five years. To be successful you need to be flexible and be curious.

Here's what the tech world looked like when I was born.

## Learning Never Stops

Some of my first experiences programming were when I was in high school. I remember opening the source code for QBasics Gorillas to try and hack the physics system when I should have probably been doing classwork. I also created text-based adventure games on my TI-83+ when I needed to be practice pre-calculus. Programming has always been about building and creating for me. I love the power the computer provides for creating your own world. I still love this about programming. I'm constantly exploring new languages and frameworks so that I can build something cool.

I never intended on becoming a teacher, but my first day in the classroom I knew that I had found where I belong. You have to be open to new experiences and reflect on what makes you happy. Despite never intending to be an educator, I love what I do. In 2019 I started my Master's degree in Educational Leadership and Policy at ETSU. I graduated in December of 2020, and I looking to start my Ph.D. soon. It's not the diplomas that drive me. I just want to push myself and learn more.

I'd encourage you to find something you want to invest in. Passion is built on the investment of time. You will become passionate about anything you invest your time in. Explore broadly while you are young because you never know where things will lead you.
