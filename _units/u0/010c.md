## Introduction to GitHub

GitHub will be one of the primary tools we will use this semester. From coding exercises to major projects, you will need to have a solid understanding of the process and tools.

In this assignment, you will learn how to use GitHub and build a small project on the platform. The project will be a Slide Deck that introduces yourself.

### Creating an Account

**Note:** You can skip this part if you already have a GitHub account. Just login using your creditials and skip to step 3.

1. Visit [`https://github.com/join`](https://github.com/join) where you'll see the following form:

   - Choose an appropriate username. This should be professional and not reveal any personal information.
   - Use a personal email address - school email accounts can't be verified.
   - If you do not want to use a personal email address, you can use a parent's email address. [Email me](mailto:dbailey@k12k.com) if you have questions about the account.
2. Verify your account by checking your personal email account and confirming your email.
3. Submit your GitHub Username using the form below:

### GitHub Training Lab

GitHub provides a great training lab that will introduce you to their tools by using the tools themself.

1. Open [https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).
   - Make sure you're signed in using your GitHub account (top right corner).
2. Start on Course step 1 `Assign yourself`.
3. Proceed through the instructions to build your Slide Deck. Reach out if you get stuck.

**Be sure you read carefully.** Reading the instructions is not optional and is an important skill you will need to be successful this semester.

### Making It Your Own

Now that you have successfully set up a project on GitHub, it is time for you to make it your own. Follow the instructions learned in the Training Lab to add additional slides. Edit the slides that tells us about yourself.

## Additional Resources

While the Github Lab will guide you step-by-step, I know sometimes it's easier to have additional ways of learning the material. Here is a video that walks you through the same content. It might help if you're stuck.
