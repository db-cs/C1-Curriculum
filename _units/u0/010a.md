I always hated going around the room to introduce ourselves when I was a student, but it's important for me to get to know you. Complete the form below. I know forms are lame, but it's the best way for us to communicate. Yes, I will actually read this, so please open up a little. The better I know you the better I can serve you.

**Note:** The question about music for the class is geared more for our time face to face, but I still want to know. When we do come back together, I will have this ready. Also, I will be listening to it on my own. I think music gives us a way to glimpse a little piece of each other, and it's a good way for me to get to know you better.
