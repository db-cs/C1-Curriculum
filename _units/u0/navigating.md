## Announcements

Each week an announcement will be added that outlines the week's work. These will appear at the top of the `Home` page in this course, but can also be found on the `Announcements` page.

You need to check the announcement each day to make sure there are no changes or updates. This where be where I communicate each day's work, so if you miss a day please check here first then contact me with questions.

## Course Pack

Each unit will have a course pack that has a ðŸ§­ icon before the title. The course pack is where you'll find all the information for the unit. All the instructions for assignments and other important information you will need to complete the unit.

**Note:** If you are viewing the course pack on a small screen, you will need to use the "hamburger menu" to view all the pages available.

<div style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block; padding: 5px 8px;">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" width="24" height="24">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth=2 d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16" />
</svg>
</div>

**Note:** You can also open the course pack in a new tab by clicking the title at the top in Canvas. I'd recommend doing this so you can easily access the course pack while you are working in Canvas.

## Dropbox

Every assingment will have a dropbox on Canvas that has a ðŸ“¥ icon before the title. Each dropbox is numbered and has a corresponding page on the course pack. Instructions for submitting can be found on the course pack page.

**Note:** All assignments will have a due date listed underneath. Assignments may be submitted by Sunday after that date,

**Note:** You should see a checkmark beside the assignment in Modules once you have successfully submited.

### Tests

Some of the Dropboxes will be tests that will act as another layer of evidence that you have mastered the standards. They will appear on Canvas with a ðŸ§ª icon before the title. Each test will coorelate to the standards that we have been studying, and will help me see what you have learned. Please take these seriously, but don't let them intimidate you.

### Rubric

Each assignment will also have a rubric attached to the dropbox on Canvas that will describe how the assignment will be graded. Be sure to look this over before you start on an assignment, so you are aware of what skills or concepts you should be demonstrating.

**Note:** The rubrics can be hard to find on certain types of assignments, so the best way to find them is to go to the `Grades` page. Click on an assignment. On the top right corner, you will see a link to `Show Rubric`.

## Grades and Feedback

We will be using Standards-Based grading this semester (like your math courses). You will need to know the standard you are being evaluated on and the rating scale to understand how you are performing. All the standards and the rating scale can be found on the [Syllabus](/syllabus){: target="\_blank"}. Each assignment has a rubric based on the standard, and after I grade them it is important that you check the rubric and comments. You need to check the `Grades` page at least once per week to check for feedback and ratings.

Any assignment may be reattempted. You just need to communicate with me that you want to retry it, and we can work something out. Sometimes due to the nature of deadlines, it is not possible to make something up. In those cases we will find an alternative way for you to demonstrate mastery.
