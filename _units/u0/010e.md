   - Make sure you're signed in using your GitHub account (top right corner).
2. Start with `Generate a GitHub Pages site`.
3. Follow the instructions to create your blog.

After you have completed the tutorial, it's time to make it your own.

2. Open the the `_config.yml` and update the releavant information like title and description.
3. On the repository, update the description and url by clicking the gear beside about on the Code tab.

## Why You Should Blog

In order to model blogging for you, I'll be posting as well this smester. I have added my first post which details the benefits of blogging you learning.
My 2021 Dev Blog can be found at [https://mrbailey.codes/2021-dev-blog/](https://mrbailey.codes/2021-dev-blog/).

❗️ Read my [blog post](https://mrbailey.codes/2021-Dev-Blog/2021/01/10/why-i-blog.html) to see an example post and get some ideas of why you should blog as a student developer. I may ask you about some of the points from the article, so be sure you skim through it.

## Your First Post

For your first post, I want you to title it `Hello, world!`. Remember your audience is not me. You should write this for other learners and potentially for employers. its content should include the following:

1. Personal Introduction
   - Introduce yourself to readers and explain why you are blogging.
   - Add your Intro Slide Deck here.
2. Goals
   - What do you hope to learn/build in this class?
   - What are your goals for you career? If you don't have specific job in mind, what are some things it must include.
3. GitHub
   - What did you learn about GitHub over the last week?
   - What suprised you?
   - What are you still trying to learn more about?

Here's the link again for [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which may help with formatting.
