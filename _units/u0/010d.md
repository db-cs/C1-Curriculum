Now that you have finished [010.C Intro Slide Deck](010c.md) it's time to present. We will use Flipgrid to record these presentations, and post for others to view. Being able to present your work is an essential skill, and one that we will continue work on throughout the semester.

## Screen Recording with Flipgrid

You will need to open the Dropbox above to access the Flipgrid. You will also need to have your Intro Slide Deck open in another tab. Instead of using your camera, you'll need to switch the Options to Record Screen. When you are ready start the recording. When you finish you can edit your video to trim off any mistakes.

For more information read through [Screen Recording: How to record your screen using the Flipgrid camera](https://help.flipgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045940833-Screen-Recording-How-to-record-your-screen-using-the-Flipgrid-camera).

### Submitting

Once you have finished recording and editing, you will submit your Flipgrid. This will also submit it on Canvas, so you will not need to take any further action.

## Reviewing Other Presentations

Now that you have finished, I want you to review at least 2 other presentations. Record a comment sharing one of the following:

- Something you have in common
- Something you found interesting in their presentation
- A question that you have for the presenter

Comments can be either in video or text form. Here's a help article on [Comments: Replying with a Video Comment](https://help.flipgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044877654-Comments-Replying-with-a-Video-Comment) and [Text Comments - Replying to video Responses with text](https://help.flipgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055758813).
