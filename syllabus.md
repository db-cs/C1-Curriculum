# ðŸ’» Welcome to C1

## What Is This Course?

C1 is the second course in the Coding program of study. In this course, we will dive deeply into programming constructs and professional practices.

## Who Is This Course For?

C1 is designed for students that are curious about software development and want to go deeper into how to write programs. You should feel comfortable with Algebra concepts.

## What Will I Learn?

During the course you'll learn to:

- deconstruct real-world problems
- collaborate with others to create solutions
- write algortihms that describe solutions to the computer

Read through the [Standards](#standards) below to see more about what we will be learning this semester.

## How Do I Succeed In This Course?

To be successful in this course, you need to be curious about how programming works. Ask questions and think deeply. You must move beyond just writing the correct code, and start using computational and algorithmic thinking.

You will need to read carefully and think deeply. You must be willing work with others and listen to their ideas.

**ðŸ‘‰ The number one way to succeed in this class is to be engaged. Soak up everything you can from every assignment and experience.**

## What Are The Expectations?

- We deliver our best work, not just our first work.
- We give grace to others and ourselves.
- We consider the impacts of our decisions and deal with the consequences of our actions.
- We value the contributions of our team and celebrate our successes.

## What If I Need Accomodations?

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options.

| `AAP1`     | To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, developers represent and organize data in multiple ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `AAP2`     | The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Developers incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.                                                                                                            |
| `AAP3`     | Developers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, developers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow developers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence. |
| `AAP4`     | Developers evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible. By testing and refining computational artifacts, developers seek to reduce bias and equity deficits.                                                                                                                                      |
| `AAP5`     | Evaluting the collection and generation of data through automated processes, developers can explain the privacy concerns that may not be evident to users.                                                                                                                                                                                |
